# Product / project brief

## Objective

Build Ralph into a durable, file-backed multi-agent delivery framework that can move a repository from requirements analysis through implementation, testing, and orchestration without depending on chat memory.

## Product direction

Ralph should let an operator define the work once in `.ralph/`, then execute repeatable Codex-driven iterations that stay inspectable across fresh sessions. The framework needs to strengthen both the quality of agent work and the control plane around it, so each step is deterministic, resumable, and supported by durable evidence.

## Core outcomes

- Turn requirements, progress, and task state into the shared source of truth for all agent activity.
- Support end-to-end delivery flow across requirements analysis, implementation, validation, and orchestration.
- Harden execution with explicit prompts, verifier output, provenance artifacts, and clear stop reasons.
- Keep the architecture thin and repository-backed so operators can audit, resume, and refine work without hidden state.
